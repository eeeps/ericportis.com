[Taylor Hunt’s series about the work he’s done for Kroger](https://dev.to/tigt/making-the-worlds-fastest-website-and-other-mistakes-56na) is _fantastic_. I’ve learned so much.

I learned about a popular phone:

> Target device: bestselling phone at a local Kroger
> Hot Pepper’s Poblano VLE5
> $35 ($15 on sale)

Every discussion about web performance is a discussion about class and inequality.

I learned about “streamed HTML” aka “chunked-transfer encoding” aka “early flushing”. Which makes me think about [streaming progressive images](https://blog.cloudflare.com/parallel-streaming-of-progressive-images/), but I digress.

I’m still learning! This thing is packed with fantastic links. [Go!](https://dev.to/tigt/making-the-worlds-fastest-website-and-other-mistakes-56na) Read!
