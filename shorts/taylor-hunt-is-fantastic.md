[Taylor Hunt’s series about the work he’s done for Kroger](https://dev.to/tigt/making-the-worlds-fastest-website-and-other-mistakes-56na) is _fantastic_. I’ve learned so much.

I learned about a popular phone:

<blockquote>
<dl>
<dt>Target device: bestselling phone at a local Kroger</dt>
	<dd>Hot Pepper’s Poblano VLE5</dd>
	<dd>$35 ($15 on sale)</dd>
</dl>
</blockquote>

I learned about “streamed HTML” aka “chunked-transfer encoding” aka “early flushing”.

Which makes me think about <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/parallel-streaming-of-progressive-images/">streaming progressive images</a>, but I digress.
</p></aside>

I’m still learning! This thing is packed with fantastic links. [Go!](https://dev.to/tigt/making-the-worlds-fastest-website-and-other-mistakes-56na) Read!
